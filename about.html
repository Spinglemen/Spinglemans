					Back in 1992 Akihiro Spingleman opened his first store in the middle of the prestigious "Azabu" district of Tokyo. Akihiro was inspired by the clothing designs of late 19th century West Coast Americans called "Cowboys".
<br><br>
					Using these ideas, he merged this style with modern Japanese fashion. Spingleman's quickly caught on with wealthy Japanese urbanites and has since dominated the Japanese fashion industry.
